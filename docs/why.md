# Why?

## Own Your Data
Self-hosting ensures your data stays private and under your control. No third-party tracking, no unexpected data sharing, and no external dependencies.

## Full Customization
You can configure every part of your stack—from software versions to themes and integrations—exactly how you want. There are no imposed limits or forced features.

## Lower Long-Term Costs
While there may be upfront expenses for hardware or hosting, self-hosting can eliminate recurring subscription fees, saving money over time.

## No Vendor Lock-In
You're free to move, modify, or migrate your data and services whenever you choose. No reliance on a company’s roadmap, policy changes, or unexpected shutdowns.

## Improved Performance
You can optimize performance for your specific needs without the bloat of generalized platforms. Choose the resources, stack, and scaling that work best for you.

## Better Security (When Done Right)
With the right setup, you can harden your system and reduce exposure to broad cloud-based attack vectors. You're in charge of your own security model.

## Learn and Grow
Self-hosting builds real-world skills in system administration, networking, and DevOps. It's a great hands-on learning opportunity for individuals and teams alike.

## Offline and Local Access
Maintain access to your tools and data even without an internet connection. Local-first setups reduce reliance on always-on external servers.
